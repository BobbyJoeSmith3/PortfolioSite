        <span>Bobby Joe Smith III is a Black and Indigenous (Lakota) graphic designer and media artist living on the unceded ancestral
        lands of the Tongva, Tataviam, Serrano, Kizh, and Chumash peoples commonly referred to as Los Angeles. His creative
        practice is a poetic discourse on the utilization of art and design to further anti-colonial movements and achieve
        decolonial outcomes. He studied graphic design at the Maryland Institute College of Art (Post-Bacc) and the Rhode Island
        School of Design (MFA), and received an MFA in Media Art from the University of Californiaâ€”Los Angeles.</span>
